Cafe Coffee Day is an android app which provides the description of a coffee shop named "CafeCoffeeDay".  
The app is created with the purpose of taking pre-bookings.

It includes simple codes for making button, toast, dialogue box and using picasso library.  
# Run
The app is made and thus can be run on android studio.  

It is my first android app. Hope you like it.
